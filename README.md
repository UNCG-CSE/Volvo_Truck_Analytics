## Volvo Data Description 
 
 Our group has been given data on two different Volvo Vehicles (Trucks). These trucks have been equiped with many, many sensors that log data on everything from transmission oil temperature to the time the driver spends on the accelerator, for that given vehicle. One of the main areas that is in question is a new power unit called the "APU". It doesnt depend on power of the motor, and general assumptions would say that would call for better efficency and longivity of the trucks motor. Using time series manipulations on the data given should give insight on whether these assumptions are possibly true. These trucks are based in areas with variations in elevation, so the outcome should be interesting. 
 
 ## Goals
 
 -To anaylize Volvo vehicle Long haul and short haul data
 
 -Use time series to aid in visualizations for analysis 
 
 -To determine if different metrics logged by sensors make a difference in relation to an "APU" module that is not dependent on power from   the motor  
 
 -report any discovered anomolies detected by data manipulations 
 
 ## Objectives:
 
 The following are the main areas that Volvo is interested in our group looking into. 

-Clean data and determine which vehicle is longhaul and short haul.

-Remove unused rows or columns

-Merge vehicles to identify if APU unit is making a difference on fuel economy or possible engine longivity.

-Identify commonality in features detailed from data dictionary with or without APU unit.

-Anomoly Detection within the data 

-Grouping/clustering or other visualizations in data manipulations  

## Initial Tasks
In general, some of these tasks are dependent on another, we can all work together and adjust issues/project needs accordingly

-Bill: Determine vehicle travel designation and update ReadMe.md on git.

-Chris: Adjust and format the data dictionary to metrics being used.

-James: Setup master branch with both data sets for manipulations and determine git functions on merging branches.

-Wahab: Determine whether there are rows or columns with all NaN values, if so remove them.
