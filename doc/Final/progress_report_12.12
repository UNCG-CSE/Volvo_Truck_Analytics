Wahab Ehsan
Determine whether there are rows or columns with all NaN values, if so remove them. (~3 Hours)
This was completed by Wahab Ehsan. In order to find rows that are not useful because of the excessive amounts of NaN types, the 
following conditions were taken into consideration. The number of columns for each truck is different. The times NaN type in truck1 
does not equal to the number of time NaN types appear on truck2. Columns with all NaN types are useless and are deleted using pandas. 
Rows are deleted by the threshold value percent. If the Non-NaN values are less than the percent given, then the row would be deleted. 
Initially the percent threshold is set to 75 at the moment as a global variable and can be decremented or incremented depending on 
the data needed.

Display Data by day (~3 hours) 
Function implementation of display data by day was created to sort all data by average for each day for a certain attribute. 
Goal was to create a cleaner way of looking at data to find something interesting. We were able to find out that data for Truck one 
data was the week of data or seven days which was expected, but for truck two there was only 3 days' worth of data, which was less than we were told.
This means we'll have to decide which days to compare when comparing the two trucks and which days will be not useful.

Outlier Detection data (~12 hours)
This function was made to detect all the outliers in the data for a certain attribute and have a boxplot made for visuals. 
Even though the data for truck one was 7 days' worth, the averages were very far apart making me think if there are a lot of outliers 
and after running it through the function I was able to find out that the last 3 days of data for truck one was outliers. Meaning 
there were three days worth of no useful data for Speed (km/hr).

Determining Estimator (~3 hour)
Was able to determine to use the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) because of it being non-parametric. For the bandwidth I decided to 
use a larger bandwidth since our data was scattered around. Use of this function will be beneficial in the future. 
We used this because our data had large number of outliers and was not a normal distribution. Maybe after removing the outliers 
we will switch to MLE, and we didn't choose MoM because that is also for normal distributions and not as effective in our case because of 
our several outliers in the data.

Time to Ideal Temperature with Ambient Temperature (~7 hours)
Worked on finding the time it takes to get to ideal temperature with outside temperature taken into consideration. The Data for
for time wasnt given. Had to find out the Ideal temperature for the oil. Found the average temperature of oil for each day and used
it as the Ideal temperature. Then made function to find difference of seconds between two indexes. Was able to check from begining to
whenever the temperature gets to ideal temperature and found the seconds it took to get there. Made sure the temperature difference between begining
to ideal had at least 30 degrees C difference and the session the truck is been on is at least for 600 seconds. Then was able to 
make X equals to the outside temperature and Y as the Seconds it took to get to ideal temperature. Then plotted on graph and saw positive
correlation, which was unexpected. Make least square line for predictions and was able to predict few values.

Rename Columns to Be More Readable (~2 hours)
The data that's been provided isn't very useful if we can't understand what it means, so the provided column names needed to be changed.
These changes included removing unnecessary column name parts, changing title formats, and including the unit of measurement, if 
provided, to the title for easier readability. Ambiguous titles were clarified to the best of the team's knowledge to-date, but slight 
changes may come in the future. The created function changes the column names with a Python dictionary which is currently being 
generated by CSV files.

GPS Speed vs. Wheel-Based Speed Analysis & Determination of Long/Short Haul Trucks (16+ hours)
The goal of this task was to compare GPS Speed and Wheel-Based Vehicle Speed for Truck 1 and Truck 2 internally through visual
representation and percent change, and then compare the results for each truck to each other. The results revealed a major issue
with the speed data: they are bimodal. There are two peaks for the distributions which represent a "stop" state and a
"go" state, with "stop" being all of the zero or near-zero values and "go" being all of the values at the rightmost peak near the higher
readings. This is a problem because it causes the average speed for the trucks to become inaccurate. In addition to this, the GPS Speed
readings for Truck 2 are significantly lower than its Wheel-Based counterpart, but this isn't true for Truck 1's data: they are fairly
consistent with each other in terms of hard-value readings. However, the trends are the same between the two columns in Truck 2, which
indicates that the GPS Speed component was misconfigured. Finally, this initial and basic analysis of these two columns has indicated
that the long-haul truck is Truck 1 and the short-haul is Truck 2.

Truck 2 GPS Speed Corrections (~4 hours)
As we learned from Project Progress two (2), Truck 2 has some faulty data for its GPS Speed
component. This is a bigger issue for Volvo than us, but my questions from this was "how well
would this component work if it was completely functional and what would its more correct
measurements look like?" Thankfully, Truck 1's components appear to be working perfectly fine.
This means I was able to use Truck 1's data as a model to predict what Truck 2's GPS Speed values
_should_ be. To solve this issue, I took the difference of means for Truck 1's GPS Speed and
Wheel-Based Speeds. Using that value, I iterated through Truck 2's Wheel-Based Speed values and
added that mean to each value and stored the result into a separate column. These calculated values
were the "predicted" GPS Speed values for Truck 2. I created visualizations and calculated their values 
to better analyze the results, and those results appear to be fairly consistent with the correctly measured
values for Truck 1. 

GitHub Repository Management (~10 hours)
For most of Project Progress 2, I have been given the responsibility of managing the GitHub repository in a multitude of ways. This
includes updating the home page README, creating, updating, and closing Issues, creating and assigning Labels to those Issues,
managing and assigning group members to those Issues, and trying to keep the general repository structure simple and clean.
